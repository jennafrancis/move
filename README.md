# Move

Move provides user reviews and recommendations of top fitness classes in your metro area. All users can browse the studios, classes, and reviews in their designated city, but you must log in with an email and password – or through Facebook – to add studios and classes or leave a review of your own. Each group class and user has a brief set of analytics for how many reviews they have and an average rating of customer satisfaction.

## Demo

A demo of Move is found at https://move-that-body.herokuapp.com/.

## Installation Instructions

To install a local version, fork, clone and run a rails server for a localhost version of the application. The database will initialize as empty. Run a Rails Console to create desired Cities. Once Cities are created, you may add/review studios and group classes through the user interface.

** This application is currently on Rails v 5.0.
