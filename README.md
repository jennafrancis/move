# Move

Move is designed to act similar to a Yelp, if you will, of fitness classes. Anyone can browse the studios, classes, and reviews in their designated city, but you must log in with an email and password – or through Facebook – to leave a review of your own. Each group class and user has a brief set of analytics for how many reviews they have and an average rating of customer satisfaction. Signed in users are also able to add studios, classes, and leave reviews for other users to see.
